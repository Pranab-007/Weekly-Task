colours = [ "Blue", "Black", "Orange" ]
print("The colour black is in the list : ", "Black" in colours)
Answer:The colour black is in the list: True

Which of the following concepts does the Python ‘if’ statement support?
Sequence, Selection or Iteration?
Answer:Selection
_________________________________________________________________________
What would be the output shown following the execution of the following Python statements?
num1 = 100
num2 = 10
if num1 % num2 == 0:
print("num1 is divisible by num2")
else:
print("num1 is not divisible by num2")
Answer:num1 is divisible by num2
________________________________________________________________________
What would be the output shown following the execution of the following Python statements?
num1 = 99
num2 = 70
if num1 < num2:
print("num1 is less than num2")
elif num1 > num2:
print("num1 is greater than num2")
else:
print("num1 is equal to num2")
Answer:num1 is greater than num2

What is the name given to the following type of Python operator shown below?
lowest = x if x < y else y
Answer: ternary operator
And, what value would be assigned to the variable ‘lowest’ when ‘x’ was equal to 10 and
‘y’ was equal to 5?
Answer:5

Within the answer box below write a small Python program, that asks the user to enter a
value between 1 and 10.
Once the value has been input display a message saying whether the value was in the
requested range.
Remember: values returned from the input() function are strings, and need converting
before being used within expressions, i.e. you will need code such as this -
num = input("please enter a number between 1 and 10 : ")
num = int(num)
Answer:
# Ask the user to enter a value between 1 and 10
num = input("Please enter a number between 1 and 10: ")

# Convert the input to an integer
num = int(num)

# Check if the entered value is in the requested range
if 1 <= num <= 10:
    print("The entered value is in the requested range.")
else:
    print("The entered value is outside the requested range.")

Within the answer box below write a small Python program that asks the user to enter two
values. Store these in variables called x and y respectively.
If the 'x' value is larger than 'y' then print
The value 'x' is larger than the value 'y'
otherwise print
The value 'y' is larger than the value 'x'
Answer:
# Ask the user to enter two values
x = input("Enter the first value (x): ")
y = input("Enter the second value (y): ")

# Convert the inputs to integers
x = int(x)
y = int(y)

# Compare the values and print the appropriate message
if x > y:
    print(f"The value {x} is larger than the value {y}.")
else:
    print(f"The value {y} is larger than the value {x}.")

Examine the output generated by the above program. Is the displayed text entirely accurate
in all cases? If not Why?
Answer:the displayed text entirely accurate in all case

Within the answer box below write a small Python program that asks the user to enter two
values.
Store these values in two variables then output a message displaying the result of dividing
the first value by the second value.
Include code that prevents a run-time error being reported when the user inputs a value of '0'
for the second input. Hint: use an ‘if’ statement
If a '0' value is input, print a message saying "division by 0 is not possible".
Answer:
# Ask the user to enter two values
num1 = input("Enter the first value: ")
num2 = input("Enter the second value: ")

# Convert the inputs to floats
num1 = float(num1)
num2 = float(num2)

# Check if the second value is zero before performing division
if num2 != 0:
    result = num1 / num2
    print(f"The result of {num1} divided by {num2} is: {result}")
else:
    print("Division by 0 is not possible.")
